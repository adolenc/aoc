# Advent of Code
The repository for storing my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), a yearly challenge consisting of a comfy puzzle per day for each day in December. 

I usually try to solve the puzzles the day they are published. The solutions posted here are minimally cleaned up after the fact so that they don't completely embarrass me, but otherwise contain the exact algorithms I used.
